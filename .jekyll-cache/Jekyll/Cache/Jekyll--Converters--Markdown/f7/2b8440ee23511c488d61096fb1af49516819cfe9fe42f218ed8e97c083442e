    <p>Content has different formats like text, images, audio, and video. e.g. Books, Blogs/Articles, Newsletters, Tweets, GIFs, Memes, Podcasts, Vlogs.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Overwhelmed by the information and decrease in attention span have led to increase in consumption of bite-sized content in the form of Twitter threads, Instagram posts/stories, TikTok, etc. Everything has become Game of Content.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Everyone is now a content creator, whatever you post on the internet is considered as content.  You dislike someone but still, like his/her content and vice versa.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Creating quality content requires effort and a distribution channel.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Seeking attention online is tough. Due to the attention economy, people have a shorter attention span, if you canâ€™t create better content then people will not consume your content. You can keep sharing your views, whoever finds interesting will follow and ignore the rest.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you keep consuming different types of content, you may feel like you have been learning something, but in reality, probably itâ€™s just enlightenment or epiphany for a shorter time. You read a Twitter thread, feel enlightened, donâ€™t know what to do with this feeling of enlightenment, then you start reading some more threads. Following the virtue-signaling and circle-jerking threads, tweets to gain followers are waste of time. And this vicious circle goes on and creates the illusion of learning or spending quality time.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Social media companies spend billions of dollars to keep you hooked on consuming content, it also provides a platform to create content and earn. So review your quality of content consumptions to avoid the illusion of learning.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To find better content we need a content curator. Again be careful of your content consumption, too much curation lead to curated content fatigue and living in the bubble, ignoring the rest.</p>
