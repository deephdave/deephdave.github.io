    <p>But everytime we create something new, we go from 0 to 1. The act of creation is singular, as is the moment of creation, and the result is something fresh and strange.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Today‚Äôs ‚Äúbest practices‚Äù lead to dead ends; the best path are new and untried.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Technology is miraculous because it allows us to do more with less, ratcheting up our fundamental capabilities to a higher level.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Humans don‚Äôt decide what to build by making choices from some cosmic catalog of options given in advance; instead, by creating new technologies we rewrite the plan of the world.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The paradox of teaching entrepreneurship is that such a formula cannot exist; because every innovation is new and unique, no authority can be prescribed in concrete terms how to be innovative.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Indeed, the single most powerful pattern I have noticed is that successful people find value in unexpected places, and they do this by thinking about business from first principles instead of formals.</p>

  <li>
    <p>‚ÄúWhat important truth do very few people agree with you on?‚Äù</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Brilliant thinking is rare, but courage is even shorter supply than genius.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>‚ÄúMost people believe in X, but the truth is the opposite of X.‚Äù</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If things change radically in the next decade then the future is nearly at hand.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No one can predict the future exactly, but we know two things: It is going to be different, and it must be rooted in today‚Äôs world.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Going from 0 ‚Üí 1 : Vertical or intensive progress (Technology, doing new things)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Going from 1 ‚Üí n : Horizontal or extensive progress (Globalization : Taking things that work somewhere and making them work everywhere. e.g. China)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But there is no reason why technology should be limited to computes. Properly understood, any new and better way of doing things is technology.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Even our everyday language suggest we believe in kind of technological end of  history; the division of the world into so+called developed and developing nations implies that the ‚Äúdeveloped‚Äù world has already achieved the achievable and the poorer nations just need to catch up.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Spreading old ways to create wealth around the world will result in devastation, not riches. In a world of scarce resources, globalization without new technology is unsustainable.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The smartphones that distinct us from our surrounding also distinct us from the fact that our surrounding is strangely old: only computers and communications have improved dramatically since midcentury.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>‚Ä¶it‚Äôs hard to develop new things in big organizations, and it‚Äôs even harder to do it by yourself. Bureaucratic hierarchies move slowly, and entrenched interests shy away from risk.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the most dysfunctional organizations, signalling that work is being done becomes a better strategy for career advancement than actually doing work(if this describe your company, you should quit now.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Startup operate on principle that you need to work with other people to get stuff done, but you also need to stay small enough so that you actually can.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A new company‚Äôs most important strength is new thinking: even more important than nimbleness, small size affords space to think.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>‚Ä¶exercise in thinking. Because that is what a startup has to do: question received ideas and rethink business from scratch.</p>
  </li>

    <p>‚ÄúMadness is rare in individuals ‚Äî but in groups, parties, nations and ages it is rare.‚Äù Nietzsche wrote (before he went made)</p>
