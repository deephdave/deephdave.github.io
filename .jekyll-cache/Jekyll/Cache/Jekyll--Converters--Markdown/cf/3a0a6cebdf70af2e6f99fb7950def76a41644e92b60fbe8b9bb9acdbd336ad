    <p>Anytime you’re practicing renunciation, you’re deluded. How about that! You’re
deluded. What are you renouncing? Anytime you renounce something, you are tied
forever to the thing you renounce. There’s a guru in India who says, “Every time a
prostitute comes to me, she’s talking about nothing but God. She says I’m sick of this life
that I’m living. I want God. But every time a priest comes to me he’s talking about
nothing but sex.” Very well, <strong>when you renounce something, you’re stuck to it forever.
When you fight something, you’re tied to it forever. As long as you’re fighting it, you are
giving it power. You give it as much power as you are using to fight it.</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The trouble with people is that they’re busy fixing things they don’t even
understand. We’re always fixing things, aren’t we? It never strikes us that things don’t
need to be fixed. They really don’t. This is a great illumination. They need to be
understood. If you understood them, they’d change.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A scientist observes the behavior of ants with no further end in view than to study ants, to
learn as much as possible about them. He has no other aim. He’s not attempting to train
them or get anything out of them. He’s interested in ants, he wants to learn as much as
possible about them. That’s his attitude. The day you attain a posture like that, you will
experience a miracle. You will change—effortlessly, correctly. Change will happen, you
will not have to bring it about. As the life of awareness settles on your darkness, whatever
is evil will disappear. Whatever is good will be fostered. You will have to experience that
for yourself.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Think of the loneliness that is yours. Would human company ever take it away? It
will only serve as a distraction. There’s an emptiness inside, isn’t there? And when the
emptiness surfaces, what do you do? You run away, turn on the television, turn on the
radio, read a book, search for human company, seek entertainment, seek distraction.
Everybody does that. It’s big business nowadays, an organized industry to distract us and
entertain us.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You’re much more energetic, much more alive. People think that if they had no
cravings, they’d be like deadwood. But in fact they’d lose their tension. Get rid of your
fear of failure, your tensions about succeeding, you will be yourself. Relaxed. You
wouldn’t be driving with your brakes on. That’s what would happen.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There’s a lovely saying of Tranxu, a great Chinese sage, that I took the trouble to
learn by heart. It goes: “When the archer shoots for no particular prize, he has all his
skills; when he shoots to win a brass buckle, he is already nervous; when he shoots for a
gold prize, he goes blind, sees two targets, and is out of his mind. His skill has not
changed, but the prize divides him. He cares! He thinks more of winning than of
shooting, and the need to win drains him of power.” Isn’t that an image of what most
people are? When you’re living for nothing, you’ve got all your skills, you’ve got all
your energy, you’re relaxed, you don’t care, it doesn’t matter whether you win or lose.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ignorance and fear, ignorance caused by fear, that’s where all the evil comes from,
that’s where your violence comes from. The person who is truly nonviolent, who is
incapable of violence, is the person who is fearless. It’s only when you’re afraid that you
become angry. Think of the last time you were angry. Go ahead. Think of the last time
you were angry and search for the fear behind it. What were you afraid of losing? What
were you afraid would be taken from you? That’s where the anger comes from. Think of
an angry person, maybe someone you’re afraid of. Can you see how frightened he or she
is? He’s really frightened, he really is. She’s really frightened or she wouldn’t be angry.
Ultimately, there are only two things, love and fear.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Suffering is a sign that you’re out of touch with the truth.
Suffering is given to you that you might open your eyes to the truth, that you might
understand that there’s falsehood somewhere, just as physical pain is given to you so you
will understand that there is disease or illness somewhere. Suffering points out that there
is falsehood somewhere. Suffering occurs when you clash with reality. When your
illusions clash with reality, when your falsehoods clash with truth, then you have
suffering. Otherwise there is no suffering</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Who determines what it means to be a success? This stupid society! The main
preoccupation of society is to keep society sick! And the sooner you realize that, the
better. Sick, every one of them. They are loony, they’re crazy. You became president of
the lunatic asylum and you’re proud of it even though it means nothing. Being president
of a corporation has nothing to do with being a success in life. Having a lot of money has
nothing to do with being a success in life. You’re a success in life when you wake up!
Then you don’t have to apologize to anyone, you don’t have to explain anything to
anyone, you don’t give a damn what anybody thinks about you or what anybody says
about you. You have no worries; you’re happy. That’s what I call being a success.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When you really understand this, no criticism can affect you. No flattery or praise
can affect you either. When someone says, “You’re a great guy,” what is he talking
about? He’s talking about “me,” he’s not talking about “I.” “I” is neither great nor small.
“I” is neither successful nor a failure. It is none of these labels. These things come and
go. These things depend on the criteria society establishes. These things depend on your
conditioning. These things depend on the mood of the person who happens to be talking
to you right now.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second step (this is a four-step program) is to understand that the feeling is in
you, not in reality. That’s such a self-evident thing, but do you think people know it?
They don’t, believe me. They’ve got Ph.D.s and are presidents of universities, but they
haven’t understood this. They didn’t teach me how to live at school. They taught me
everything else. As one man said, “I got a pretty good education. It took me years to get
over it.” That’s what spirituality is all about, you know: unlearning. Unlearning all the
rubbish they taught you.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Negative feelings are in you, not in reality. So stop trying to change reality. That’s
crazy! Stop trying to change the other person. We spend all our time and energy trying to
change external circumstances, trying to change our spouses, our bosses, our friends, our
enemies, and everybody else. We don’t have to change anything. Negative feelings are in
you. No person on earth has the power to make you unhappy. There is no event on earth
that has the power to disturb you or hurt you. No event, condition, situation, or person.
Nobody told you this; they told you the opposite. That’s why you’re in the mess that
you’re in right now. That is why you’re asleep. They never told you this. But it’s self-
evident.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no explanation you can give that would explain away all the sufferings and
evil and torture and destruction and hunger in the world! You’ll never explain it. You can
try gamely with your formulas, religious and otherwise, but you’ll never explain it.
Because life is a mystery, which means your thinking mind cannot make sense out of it.
For that you’ve got to wake up and then you’ll suddenly realize that reality is not
problematic, you are the problem.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pleasant experiences make life delightful. Painful experiences lead to growth.
Pleasant experiences make life delightful, but they don’t lead to growth in themselves.
What leads to growth is painful experiences. Suffering points up an area in you where
you have not yet grown, where you need to grow and be transformed and change. If you
knew how to use that suffering, oh, how you would grow. Let’s limit ourselves, for the
time being, to psychological suffering, to all those negative emotions we have. Don’t
waste your time on a single one of them. I’ve already told you what you could do with
those emotions. The disappointment you experience when things don’t turn out as you
wanted them to, watch that! Look at what it says about you. I say this without
condemnation (otherwise you’re going to get caught up in self-hatred). Observe it as you
would observe it in another person. Look at that disappointment, that depression you
experience when you are criticized. What does that say about you?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another illusion is that someone else can do this for you, that some savior or guru or
teacher can do this for you. Not even the greatest guru in the world can take a single step
for you. You’ve got to take it yourself. St. Augustine said it so marvelously: “Jesus Christ
himself could do nothing for many of his hearers.” Or to repeat that lovely Arab saying:
“The nature of the rain is the same and yet it produces thorns in the marsh and flowers in
the garden.” It is you who have to do it. No one else can help you. It is you who have to
digest your food, it is you who have to understand. No one else can understand for you. It
is you who have to seek. Nobody can seek for you. And if what you seek is truth, then
you must do this. You can lean on no one.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another illusion is that external events have the power to hurt you, that other people
have the power to hurt you. They don’t. It’s you who give this power to them.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am not compelled by any conditioning or programming from my past experiences or from my culture. Nobody has stamped anything on me, or if they have, I’m no longer reacting on the basis of that. If you had a bad experience with an American or were bitten by a dog or had a bad experience with a certain type of food, for the rest of your life you’d be influenced by that experience. And that’s bad! You need to be liberated from that. <strong>Don’t carry over experiences from the past. In fact, don’t carry over good experiences from the past either. Learn what it means to experience something fully, then drop it and move on to the next moment,
uninfluenced by the previous one. You’d be traveling with such little baggage that you
could pass through the eye of a needle. You’d know what eternal life is, because eternal
life is now, in the timeless now.</strong> Only thus will you enter into eternal life. But how many
things we carry along with us. We never set about the task of freeing ourselves, of
dropping the baggage, of being ourselves. I’m sorry to say that everywhere I go I find
Muslims who use their religion, their worship, and their Koran to distract themselves
from this task. And the same applies to Hindus and Christians.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But there’s another demon, too, who’s doing the filtering. It’s called attachment,
desire, craving. The root of sorrow is craving. Craving distorts and destroys perception.
Fears and desires haunt us. Samuel Johnson said, “The knowledge that he is to swing
from a scaffold within a week wonderfully concentrates a man’s mind.” You blot out
everything else and concentrate only on the fear, or desire, or craving. In many ways we
were drugged when we were young. We were brought up to need people. For what? For
acceptance, approval, appreciation, applause—for what they called success. Those are
words that do not correspond to reality. They are conventions, things that are invented,
but we don’t realize that they don’t correspond to reality. What is success? It is what one
group decided is a good thing. Another group will decide the same thing is bad.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There’s no violence anymore in your attempt to change yourself. Otherwise, what you call change is simply moving the furniture around. Your behavior is changed, but not you.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Did you pick up the attachment there? Peace. Her attachment to peace and calm. She
was saying, “Unless I’m peaceful, I won’t be happy.” Did it ever occur to you that you
could be happy in tension? Before enlightenment, I used to be depressed; after
enlightenment, I continue to be depressed. You don’t make a goal out of relaxation and
sensitivity. Have you ever heard of people who get tense trying to relax? If one is tense,
one simply observes one’s tension. You will never understand yourself if you seek to
change yourself. The harder you try to change yourself, the worse it gets. You are called
upon to be aware. Get the feel of that jangling telephone; get the feel of jarred nerves; get
the sensation of the steering wheel in the car. In other words, come to reality, and let
tension or the calmness take care of itself. As a matter of fact, you will have to let them
take care of themselves because you’ll be too preoccupied with getting in touch with
reality. Step by step, let whatever happens happen. Real change will come when it is
brought about, not by your ego, but by reality. Awareness releases reality to change you.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When you attain, when you are aware, increasingly you will not be bothered about
labels like “awake” or “asleep.” One of my difficulties here is to arouse your curiosity but
not your spiritual greed. Let’s come awake, it’s going to be wonderful. After a while, it
doesn’t matter; one is aware, because one lives. The unaware life is not worth living. And
you will leave pain to take care of itself.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As soon as you look at the world through an ideology you are finished. No reality
fits an ideology. Life is beyond that. That is why people are always searching for a
meaning to life. But life has no meaning; it cannot have meaning because meaning is a
formula; meaning is something that makes sense to the mind. Every time you make sense
out of reality, you bump into something that destroys the sense you made. Meaning is
only found when you go beyond meaning. Life only makes sense when you perceive it as
mystery and it makes no sense to the conceptualizing mind.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now, you need awareness and you need nourishment. You need good, healthy
nourishment. Learn to enjoy the solid food of life. Good food, good wine, good water.
Taste them. Lose your mind and come to your senses. That’s good, healthy nourishment.
The pleasures of the senses and the pleasures of the mind. Good reading, when you enjoy
a good book. Or a really good discussion, or thinking. It’s marvelous. Unfortunately,
people have gone crazy, and they’re getting more and more addicted because they do not
know how to enjoy the lovely things of life. So they’re going in for greater and greater
artificial stimulants.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the 1970s, President Carter appealed to the American people to go in for austerity.
I thought to myself: He shouldn’t tell them to be austere, he should really tell them to
enjoy things. Most of them have lost their capacity for enjoyment. I really believe that
most people in affluent countries have lost that capacity. They’ve got to have more and
more expensive gadgets; they can’t enjoy the simple things of life. Then I walk into
places where they have all the most marvelous music, and you get these records at a
discount, they’re all stacked up, but I never hear anybody listening to them—no time, no
time, no time. They’re guilty, no time to enjoy life. They’re overworked, go, go, go. If
you really enjoy life and the simple pleasures of the senses, you’d be amazed. You’d
develop that extraordinary discipline of the animal. An animal will never overeat. Left in
its natural habitat, it will never be overweight. It will never drink or eat anything that is
not good for its health. You never find an animal smoking. It always exercises as much as
it needs—watch your cat after it’s had its breakfast, look how it relaxes. And see how it
springs into action, look at the suppleness of its limbs and the aliveness of its body.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We’ve lost that. We’re lost in our minds, in our ideas and ideals and so on, and its always
go, go, go. And we’ve got an inner self-conflict which animals don’t have. And we’re
always condemning ourselves and making ourselves feel guilty. You know what I’m
talking about. I could have said of myself what one Jesuit friend said to me some years
ago: Take that plate of sweets away, because in front of a plate of sweets or chocolates, I
lose my freedom. That was true of me, too; I lost my freedom in front of all kinds of
things, but no more! I’m satisfied with very little and I enjoy it intensely. When you have
enjoyed something intensely, you need very little. It’s like people who are busy planning
their vacation; they spend months planning it, and they get to the spot, and they’re all
anxious about their reservations for flying back. But they’re taking pictures alright, and
later they’ll show you pictures in an album, of places they never saw but only
photographed. That’s a symbol of modern life. I cannot warn you enough about this kind
of asceticism. Slow down and taste and smell and hear, and let your senses come alive. If
you want a royal road to mysticism, sit down quietly and listen to all the sounds around
you. You do not focus on any one sound; you try to hear them all. Oh, you’ll see the
miracles that happen to you when your senses come unclogged. That is extremely
important for the process of change.</p>
